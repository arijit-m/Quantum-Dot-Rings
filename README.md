# Biosynthesized Quantum Dot Rings

## Overview

This project demonstrates the biosynthesis of **quantum dot (QD) rings**, nanoscale ring-like structures formed by self-assembly of extremely small quantum dots (~1.5 nm in diameter). These unique nanostructures were synthesized using **Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)** as a green, biocompatible reducing and stabilizing agent.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging confirms the formation of uniform ring-like QD assemblies, indicating a successful and reproducible biosynthesis process.
